# School_District_Analysis


## Overview of the school district analysis: 

*Explain the purpose of this analysis.*

In this project we will analyse the school district by replacing the math and reading grades for Thomas High School with NaNs. As the board of school suspects that the grades for the ninth-grade of this school are altered, we will make sure if this has an impact on the analysis. We will analyze the data and see if the disctrict and school summary is aftected, the math and reading scores by grade,scores by spending, scores by size and scores by size are affected as well.


## Results: 

*Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.*

## Summary: 

*Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.*

After replacing with NaNs the reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School we can conclude that there were only few slight changes. There were changes on average math scores and reading scores, the passing percantage for this two subjects as well for Thomas High School. Also, the overall passing score dropeped for Thomas High School. The other schools were not affected too much by the replacement of the scores.
